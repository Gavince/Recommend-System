Mushroom Classification
---------------------------

This dataset comes from *UCI Machine Learning Repositpry* (`Link`__)

This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in 
the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, 
or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly 
states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like *leaflets three, let it be*
for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

We have already clear the data and generate a set of features.

You can find the data used in this demo in the path ``/demo/classification/mushroom/``.
